This project is the third task for the Prodigy InfoTech Python Programming Internship. It focuses on building a Python-based Password Complexity Checker that evaluates the strength of a user-provided password. The tool analyzes the password using key criteria such as its length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, inclusion of numerical digits, and the use of special characters. Based on these factors, the program categorizes the password as weak, moderate, or strong, and provides constructive feedback to help users improve their password security. The tool is designed with user interaction in mind, guiding individuals toward creating robust passwords that are more resistant to brute-force or dictionary attacks. This task helps reinforce concepts such as regular expressions, string handling, conditionals, and user-friendly output, while highlighting the importance of cybersecurity and secure authentication practices.
